We can use view in postgre to view a big project
For example,


CREATE VIEW billing AS
SELECT
    c.cust_name,
    o.ord_date,
    p.p_name,
    p.price,
    oi.quantity,
    (oi.quantity*p.price) AS total_price
        FROM order_items oi
        JOIN
            products p ON oi.p_id=p.p_id
        JOIN
            orders o ON o.ord_id=oi.ord_id
        JOIN
            customers c ON o.cust_id=c.cust_id;



SELECT * FROM billing;

Now we can use this view in any query
Here we have stored the query, not the data
